## Algorithms and Data Structures â€“ Assignments Repository

This repository is created to track my Java learning journey through assignments given by Mr. Kennedy Azupwah. These assignments help me apply the concepts I am learning and understand how well I have picked them up.

Each assignment is added here in a folder like `Assignment-1`, `Assignment-2`, and so on â€” based on whatâ€™s assigned during the semester.

### Assignment-1

#### Average Temperature Calculator

In this assignment, we were asked to:
- Take the number of days as input from the user
- Input the temperature for each day
- Calculate the average temperature
- Display how many days had temperatures above the average

This was built using basic Java concepts like:
- Arrays
- Loops (`for`, enhanced for)
- Data types like `int` and `double`
- User input via `Scanner`
- Conditional statements

The code is in `Assignment-1/TemperatureAnalysis.java`, and I'm ready to walk through it one-on-one anytime with Mr. Azupwah to explain my approach, how I structured it, and why I used what I used ðŸ˜„

### Assignment-2

#### Movie Theatre Seat Booking System

This program simulates a movie theatre with a 5x5 seating grid. It allows users to:

- View the current seating chart
- Reserve a seat (and get suggestions if the seat is taken)
- Cancel a reservation

Seats are represented using a 2D array (`char[][]`), where:
- `'O'` means the seat is **available**
- `'X'` means the seat is **reserved**

The menu runs in a loop and takes input via `Scanner`. It validates user entries and prints friendly messages to guide the user through booking or canceling.

This assignment helped me work with:
- 2D arrays
- Switch statements
- Input validation
- Simple real-world logic implementation

I can explain all the parts of this code in a one-on-one session when convenient for Mr. Azupwah


#### More Assignments will be added here as they come.

This repo is mostly for practicing writing clean, understandable code â€” no AI-generated stuff â€” just solid Java.

I Like keeping a track of what we are learning and this README helps me keep notes on what I have been working on and how.
