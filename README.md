## Algorithms and Data Structures â€“ Assignments Repository

This repository is created to track my Java learning journey through assignments given by Mr. Kennedy Azupwah. These assignments help me apply the concepts I am learning and understand how well I have picked them up.

Each assignment is added here in a folder like `Assignment-1`, `Assignment-2`, and so on â€” based on whatâ€™s assigned during the semester.

### Assignment-1

#### Average Temperature Calculator

In this assignment, we were asked to:
- Take the number of days as input from the user
- Input the temperature for each day
- Calculate the average temperature
- Display how many days had temperatures above the average

This was built using basic Java concepts like:
- Arrays
- Loops (`for`, enhanced for)
- Data types like `int` and `double`
- User input via `Scanner`
- Conditional statements

The code is in `Assignment-1/TemperatureAnalysis.java`, and I'm ready to walk through it one-on-one anytime with Mr. Azupwah to explain my approach, how I structured it, and why I used what I used ðŸ˜„

#### More Assignments Coming

As Mr. Azupwah gives new tasks, Iâ€™ll keep updating this repo accordingly. Each new folder will contain one assignment and will follow a similar style.

This repo is mostly for practicing writing clean, understandable code â€” no fancy tricks or AI-generated stuff â€” just solid Java.
